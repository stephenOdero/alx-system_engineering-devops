0x01: Shell Permissions
In this project, I am learning about working with Shell and the permissions that a user, group or other users can have. 
chmod, chgrp,chown,su,sudo
0-iam_betty: The script switches from the current user to the user 'betty'
1-who_am_i: This script prints the effective uesrname of the current user
2-groups: This script prints all the groups the current user is part of.
3-new_owner: This script changes the owner of the file 'hello' to the user 'betty'
4-empty: This script creates an empty file called hello
